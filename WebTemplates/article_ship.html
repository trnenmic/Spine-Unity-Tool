                    After your space shuttle gets destroyed, you figure out that there is no escape. You start to
                    realize
                    that you need to find some help, but all the people are gone. You find dead bodies in the hangar
                    zone,
                    but you are sure it's not all the people on this giant station. Where did they go?
